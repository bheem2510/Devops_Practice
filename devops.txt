We often celebrate the individual hero or heroine who (purportedly) creates something ingenious alone — the maverick innovator. However, reality constantly shows us that most innovations are the result of teamwork. This is true when for designing an internal developer platform as well. The internal platform can deliver exceptional value. However, to reach its full potential, it makes sense to move away from developing platforms in single-player mode and go multiplayer mode to supercharge your internal platform. But what exactly does this mean? 

While many organizations go full steam ahead with building an internal platform, they don’t always make use of all the resources and expertise they have in-house. Instead, there are often various, siloed, teams building platforms that solve their problems — but they aren’t communicating with other teams that could use and enhance the platform they are building. If it is not multiple teams with competing or duplicative platforms, organizations sometimes pile the responsibility for developing a platform squarely on platform teams.
